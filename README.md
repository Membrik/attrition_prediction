# Predicting Attrition

A small project to analyze and predict attrition.

Hiring and retaining employees is complex and costly::
“Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring”.

“Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate”.

“An average company loses anywhere between 1% and 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed”.

"Hiring a new employee costs an average of $7645 (0-500 corporation)."

"It takes 52 days on average to fill a position."

Exploratory Data Analysis performed with dataprep, pandas and plotly or alternatively using streamli (command: "streamlit run script.py")
Predicive model with ScikitLearn.

Repo includes a Jupyter Notebook (EDA + Modelling) and a python script (Interative EDA with streamlit).

For this project we will use a dataset made available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
